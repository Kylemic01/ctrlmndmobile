// üéØ GOAL: Build a personalized quiz result generator for an athlete mindset quiz.
// The result includes:
// - A mindset profile title (based on Q4)
// - A stat sentence (generic or mapped to profile)
// - A motivational sentence combining:
//     ‚Üí Q1: What drives you
//     ‚Üí Q8: What mindset area they'd improve
//     ‚Üí Q6: What their best performances have in common

// üß† Step 1: Map Q4 (How do you prepare mentally?) to a mindset profile title:
const profileTitleMap: Record<string, string> = {
  "I follow a mental routine": "The Locked-In Leader",
  "I try to calm myself but struggle": "The Wired-But-Wavering",
  "I get hyped but sometimes overdo it": "The High-Intensity Hustler",
  "I visualize success": "The Mental Mapper",
  "I try to stay loose and relaxed": "The Flow-Seeker",
  "I just wing it": "The Freestyle Performer"
};

// üìä Step 2: Map Q1 (What drives you?) to a natural-sounding trait phrase:
const driveMap: Record<string, string> = {
  "Proving people wrong": "a hunger to prove others wrong",
  "Becoming the best version of myself": "a drive to grow and evolve",
  "Winning and dominating": "a competitive fire",
  "Pushing past limits": "a desire to test your limits",
  "Fear of failure": "the pressure of not falling short",
  "Making the most of my potential": "a deep sense of untapped potential"
};

// üöÄ Step 3: Map Q6 (Best performance trait) to a motivational outcome:
const performanceMap: Record<string, string> = {
  "I felt calm and in control": "stay composed and sharp",
  "I believed in myself": "trust yourself more often",
  "I stayed focused the entire time": "build laser focus",
  "I was loose and confident": "stay relaxed under pressure",
  "I had a strong routine leading up to it": "build powerful habits",
  "I didn't overthink": "compete with clarity"
};

// üõ†Ô∏è Step 4: Combine everything into a final result generator:
function generateQuizResult(answers: Record<string, string>) {
  const profileTitle = profileTitleMap[answers["How do you prepare mentally before a big moment?"]] || "The Focused Competitor";
  const drivePhrase = driveMap[answers["What drives you"]] || "a desire to improve";
  const mindsetImprovement = answers["If you could upgrade just one part of your mindset, what would it be?"] || "your mindset";
  const outcomePhrase = performanceMap[answers["What's one thing your best performances have in common?"]] || "reach your next level";
  const stat = "Based on your selections, 27% of athletes have similar responses to you.";

  return {
    title: profileTitle,
    stat,
    sentence: `You are driven by ${drivePhrase}, so let's get you ${mindsetImprovement.toLowerCase()}.`,
    outcome: `We want you to ${outcomePhrase} and unlock your best performances.`
  };
}



{{mindset profile}} Athletes have reported these results: (using circle percentage icon that is filled according to the stat)
"96% of athletes improved."
"81% felt they recovered faster."
"87% increase in confidence"
"74% performed better under pressure."
"95% felt more focused."
"90% felt happier & healthier"

## Implementation Steps (2024-06-28)

1. **Quiz Data Storage**
   - After the user completes the quiz and sees the result, save their answers (not the result screen) to Supabase under their user profile (using their Supabase user ID).
   - This is for admin/analytics use only; users do not need to see their past results in-app.

2. **Result Screen Structure**
   - The result screen is part of the QuizWizard flow (not a separate screen).
   - The "I want results" button is always visible.

3. **Athlete Stats**
   - Use fixed percentage stats as provided in the plan.
   - Animate the circle percentage icon to the stat value.

4. **Paywall Flow**
   - After clicking "I want results," show a temporary "Continue" button/page (to be replaced by the RevenueCat paywall later).
   - The paywall is always shown after the result.

5. **Design Consistency & Animation**
   - The result screen uses the app's color scheme and typography.
   - Add a reveal animation for the profile name/content (e.g., fade/slide in).

6. **Quiz Navigation**
   - Users can go back and change answers at any time during the quiz.
   - No "restart quiz" button is needed.
